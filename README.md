# Simulation and layout design of a Mod-100 Decimal Counter
-Operating at the frequency of 1GHz along with a 1pF capacitor load.
-The layout was created on Microwind and simulations were done on DSCH3.
-Used the 180 nm technology node (cmos018 rule).
-Project was done as a part of the course EEE F313 Analog and Digital VLSI Design
